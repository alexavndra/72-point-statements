## <span style="color:#4c956c">General/Overall statement</span>
I'm confident that I'd be a great fit for Point 72 Asset Management because knowing that I have the chance to make an impact–big and small–in the industry drives me to continuously learn and improve in my craft, and this drive is what I feel Point 72 would benefit from. Though I am beginning my journey into the financial and venture capital field, I'm confident that my skills gained from both my major *and* multiple positions–both current and past–would be immensely beneficial to the role, as my experience in procedures such as conducting financial research, data collection and analysis, presenting to business stakeholders and investors, operation optimization, collaboration, and inter-department communication would make hedge funding a more sufficient–and effective–process. To know this is a possibility greatly interests me and motivates me to improve on my skills–and self. Overall, I believe my background and my enthusiasm for the finance industry make me a well-suited candidate for the company, and I am eager to contribute to Point 72's innovative work in this field.
